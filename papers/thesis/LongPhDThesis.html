<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="long2016formal">
    Type-and-effect systems are a powerful tool for program construction and
    verification. Type-and- effect systems are useful because it help reduce bugs
    in computer programs, enable compiler optimiza- tions and provide program
    documentation. As software systems increasingly embrace dynamic features and
    complex modes of compilation, static effect systems have to reconcile over
    competing goals such as precision, soundness, modularity, and programmer
    productivity. In this thesis, we propose the idea of combining static and
    dynamic analysis for effect systems to improve precision and flexibility.

    We describe intensional effect polymorphism, a new foundation for effect
    systems that integrates static and dynamic effect checking. Our system allows
    the effect of polymorphic code to be intension- ally inspected. It supports a
    highly precise notion of effect polymorphism through a lightweight notion of
    dynamic typing. When coupled with parametric polymorphism, the powerful system
    utilizes runtime information to enable precise effect reasoning, while at the
    same time retains strong type safety guaran- tees. The technical innovations
    of our design include a relational notion of effect checking, the use of
    bounded existential types to capture the subtle interactions between static
    typing and dynamic typing, and a differential alignment strategy to achieve
    efficiency in dynamic typing.

    We introduce the idea of first-class effects, where the computational effect
    of an expression can be programmatically reflected, passed around as values,
    and analyzed at run time. A broad range of de- signs “hard-coded" in existing
    effect-guided analyses can be supported through intuitive programming
    abstractions. The core technical development is a type system with a couple of
    features. Our type sys- tem provides static guarantees to application-specific
    effect management properties through refinement types, promoting
    “correct-by-design" effect-guided programming. Also, our type system computes
    not only the over-approximation of effects, but also their
    under-approximation. The duality unifies the common theme of permission vs.
    obligation in effect reasoning.

    Finally, we show the potential benefit of intensional effects by applying it
    to an event-driven system to obtain safe concurrency. The technical
    innovations of our system include a novel effect system to soundly approximate
    the dynamism introduced by runtime handlers registration, a static analysis to
    pre- compute the effects and a dynamic analysis that uses the precomputed
    effects to improve concurrency. Our design simplifies modular concurrency
    reasoning and avoids concurrency hazards.
