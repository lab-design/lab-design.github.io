<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="dyer2013bringing">
    Mining software repositories provides developers and researchers a chance to
    learn from previous development activities and apply that knowledge to the
    future. Ultra-large-scale open source repositories (e.g., SourceForge with
    350,000+ projects, GitHub with 250,000+ projects, and Google Code with
    250,000+ projects) provide an extremely large corpus to perform such mining
    tasks on. This large corpus allows researchers the opportunity to test new
    mining techniques and empirically validate new approaches on real-world data.
    However, the barrier to entry is often extremely high. Researchers interested
    in mining must know a large number of techniques, languages, tools, etc, each
    of which is often complex. Additionally, performing mining at the scale
    proposed above adds additional complexity and often is difficult to achieve.

    The Boa language and infrastructure was developed to solve these problems. We
    provide users a domain-specific language tailored for software repository
    mining and allow them to submit queries via our web-based interface. These
    queries are then automatically parallelized and executed on a cluster,
    analyzing a dataset containing almost 700,000 projects, history information
    from millions of revisions, millions of Java source files, and billions of AST
    nodes. The language also provides an easy to comprehend visitor syntax to ease
    writing source code mining queries. The underlying infrastructure contains
    several optimizations, including query optimizations to make single queries
    faster as well as a fusion optimization to group queries from multiple users
    into a single query. The latter optimization is important as Boa is intended
    to be a shared, community resource. Finally, we show the potential benefit of
    Boa to the community by reproducing a previously published case study and
    performing a new case study on the adoption of Java language features.
