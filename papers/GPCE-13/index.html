<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="dyer2013declarative">
    Software repositories contain a vast wealth of information about software
    development. Mining these repositories has proven useful for detecting
    patterns in software development, testing hypotheses for new software
    engineering approaches, etc. Specifically, mining source code has yielded
    significant insights into software development artifacts and processes.
    Unfortunately, mining source code at a large-scale remains a difficult task.
    Previous approaches had to either limit the scope of the projects studied,
    limit the scope of the mining task to be more coarse-grained, or sacrifice
    studying the history of the code due to both human and computational
    scalability issues. In this paper we address the substantial challenges of
    mining source code: a) at a very large scale; b) at a fine-grained level of
    detail; and c) with full history information.

    To address these challenges, we present domain-specific language features for
    source code mining. Our language features are inspired by object-oriented
    visitors and provide a default depth-first traversal strategy along with two
    expressions for defining custom traversals. We provide an implementation of
    these features in the Boa infrastructure for software repository mining and
    describe a code generation strategy into Java code. To show the usability of
    our domain-specific language features, we reproduced over 40 source code
    mining tasks from two large-scale previous studies in just 2 person-weeks. The
    resulting code for these tasks show between 2.0x-4.8x reduction in code size.
    Finally we perform a small controlled experiment to gain insights into how
    easily mining tasks written using our language features can be understood,
    with no prior training. We show a substantial number of tasks (75%) were
    understood by study participants, in about 3 minutes per task.
