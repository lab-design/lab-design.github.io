<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="rajan2010building">
    Software systems must face two challenges today: growing complexity and
    increasing parallelism in the underlying computational models. The problem of
    increased complexity is often solved by dividing systems into modules in a way
    that permits analysis of these modules in isolation.

    The problem of lack of concurrency is often tackled by dividing system
    execution into tasks that permits execution of these tasks in isolation. The
    key challenge in software design is to manage the explicit and implicit
    dependence between modules that decreases modularity. The key challenge for
    concurrency is to manage the explicit and implicit dependence between tasks
    that decreases parallelism. Even though these challenges appear to be
    strikingly similar, current software design practices and languages do not
    take advantage of this similarity. The net effect is that the modularity and
    concurrency goals are often tackled mutually exclusively. Making progress
    towards one goal does not naturally contribute towards the other.

    My position is that for programmers that are not formally and rigorously
    trained in the concurrency discipline the safest and most productive way to
    get scalability in their software is by improving modularity of their software
    using programming language features and design practices that reconcile
    modularity and concurrency goals. I briefly discuss preliminary efforts of my
    group, but we have only touched the tip of the iceberg.
