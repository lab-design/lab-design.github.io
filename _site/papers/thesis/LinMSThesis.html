<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="lin2016paninij">
    Increasing the speed of single-core processors has been facing practical
    challenges. Instead, multi- core architecture has been ascending for the past
    decade as the dominant architecture. To gain full advantage of multi-core
    processors, it is unavoidable for programmers to write concurrent programs.
    However, writing and reasoning about concurrent programs is often difficult
    for programmers. One reason for the difficulty stems from the hurdle of
    dealing with concurrency abstractions, the other reason is the difficulty in
    getting rid of concurrency related bugs. To address these problems, a new
    abstraction for concurrent programming has been proposed called capsule.
    Capsules are inspired by the long- standing ideas explored in the context of
    message-passing concurrency (MPC) abstractions and other similar models.
    Although the jury is still out on MPC abstractions as the de facto abstraction
    for concurrency, their wide availability and advantages combine to warrant
    research on the use of this model for concurrency. Capsules explore a new
    point in this design space to balance flexibility and analyzability in the MPC
    programming models. Unlike common avatars of the MPC model, a capsule is
    statically deployed and configured, confines its local states, permits only a
    single activity within itself, and communicates with other capsules in a
    logically synchronous manner. This thesis focuses on the realization,
    applicability and performance of this new abstraction. A major contribution of
    this work is the realization of capsules. We have implemented capsules as an
    extension of javac, the industrial strength standard Java compiler. The
    implementation shows that it is feasible to extend an object- oriented
    language with capsules. The default compilation strategy of capsules is based
    on threads. In this work, we also show alternative compilation strategies to
    improve the flexibility and adaptability of capsules. This shows that the
    capsule abstraction can be decoupled from concrete strategies for processing
    capsule messages and different underlying message processing mechanisms can be
    deployed without changing the user facing source code. This work also shows
    the strategy used to retain meta- information about capsules after
    compilation, so that capsule-oriented programs enjoy the property of separate
    compilation.
