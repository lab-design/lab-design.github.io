It features:

* Annotation of article-article-links by means of configurable relations (link-types).
* Annotation of articles with simple data-values that are assigned to configurable attributes.
* Support for using physical units of measurement in all numerical attributes, without need
  for prior configuration.

The annotation data will be combined with annotations from the current
category system to generate standard-compliant OWL/RDF output, which
can be fully processed with tools that support OWL DL or OWL Lite, but
which can also be treated in a meaningful way by software that
supports RDF, RDFS or XML.

! Relations

Relations (link-types) are defined as link with the following syntax:
<verbatim>
  relation::pagename
</verbatim>

! Attributes

Attributes are defined as link with the following syntax:

<verbatim>
  attribute:=value
</verbatim>

Attributes and relations refer only to the current page - the current
page is the subject, the relation the predicate, the linked page the
object in a RDF triple. Relations always refer to another page,
attributes not.

! Example
